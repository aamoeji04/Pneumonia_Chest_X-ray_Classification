##Overview 

We built a convolutional neural network to predict the prescence of pneumonia in chest x-rays of children. Due to our business problem, we prioritized recall and accuracy metrics. We were more tolerant towards false positives, but of course did not want to over predict on the pneumonia class, and for this reason we took accuracy metrics into consideration when evalutating our model.

Summary of final model:

## Business Problem

Those who exam x-rays in order to make a diagonsis are required to obtain years of training. Having a predcitive model that can determine whether an x-ray shows signs of pneumonia can be an extremely powerful too for understaffed health care facilities. This can be a helpful tool for the medical community to consider when resourced need to better better allocated. 

## Data 

The data consists of 5,863 x-ray images. The data set shows both baterical and viral pneumonia
